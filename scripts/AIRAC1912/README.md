# AIRAC 1912

These are files with aeronautical data, downloaded from openflightmaps.org. The data dates back from December 2019, before open flightmaps moved from the AIXM file format to OFMX, which does presently not contain procedures, such as traffic circuits or entry/exit routes to and from control zones.

I plan to use this data until open flightmaps make procedures available through the OFMX format.
